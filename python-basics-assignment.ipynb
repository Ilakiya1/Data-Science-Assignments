","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language.\n- When dealing with identifiers, python treats uppercase and lowercase variable or function name differently.\n- Each name should be unique when naming the variable, function and class.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4) What is the correct extension of the Python file? \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Python files can be mentioned using several extensions\n- some of them are \n- **.py, .pyi, .pyc, .ipynb,** etc\n- But the correct extention of a python file is **.py** which is used to indicate that a file contains a Python code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5) Is Python code compiled or interpreted? \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Python code is interpreted, which means the code is converted into byte code and executed line by line and performs any operation and produces the result.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6) Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language? \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Python uses block of code to perform some operation.\n- These block of code can be defined in several ways \n- 1. Functions : Functions are blocks of code which is used to perform specific task\n- 2. If-else statements : If-else statements are blocks of code that are used to control the flow execution based on some condition\n- 3. Loops : Loops are blocks of code that repeat a set of opeartions until a certain condition is met.\n- 4.
